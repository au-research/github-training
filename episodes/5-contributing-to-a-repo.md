*For this episode you will need a partner. Pair up and exchange GitHub usernames.*

If you are making contributions to a repo that belongs to someone else, there is a good chance that you will not be able to push changes directly to it (unless you have been given push privileges).

If you cannot push directly to another repo, but want to submit changes for its owner to consider, you will need to follow this workflow:

1. **Fork** the repo to create your own copy
1. Edit and **commit** any changes to your forked repo
1. Submit a **pull request** for the owner to consider pulling your changes to the upstream repo

The repo owner will consider your changes in their review process and accept your changes, suggest revisions to your changes, or reject your changes.

**Activity** (20 minutes): Fork your partner's repo and make changes to one or more of the files. Then, submit a pull request for your partner to review. Then, swap roles and repeat.

# Good collaborative practices

*For this episode you will need a partner. Zoom host has assigned learners in pairs, Pair up and exchange GitHub usernames.*

In GitHub, issues are a way of creating, assigning, and tracking tasks in a project. The way issues are used in a project should be agreed upon by the members of the project team.

Creating a new issue requires a title - a short description of the problem to be solved. It is helpful to add a longer description in the initial comment field. These comments can use GitHub-flavoured markdown to add formatting, including checklists.

**Activity** (5 minutes): Create a new issue and assign it to yourself. Use [GitHub-flavoured markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to add a checklist of items within the issue description (hint: use square brackets).

**Activity** (5 minutes): Create a second issue and assign it to your partner. Were you successful? If not, ask your partner to comment on the issue and try to assign it to them again.

When you submit a pull request, it is very important to follow a repo's contribution guidelines. These guidelines should outline how to submit a change request and what kind of changes are likely to be accepted or rejected. Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file to let others know how they can contribute to your project.

Another useful file to add to your project is a REUSE.md. By outlining the reuse possibilities, you are making your material a little FAIRer.

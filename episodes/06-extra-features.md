## Pages

GitHub Pages offer an automated way to create a website that is version controlled and accessible for collaboration

Collaborating on a GitHub Pages website uses the same Git/GitHub workflow you learned for collaborating via a GitHub repository.

Demonstration: (5 minutes) Here is how we used GitHub pages to create a one stop shop for our FAIR 101 Express online training course. 

## Zenodo

 A GitHub repo can be linked to Zenodo, so that when a new release is created in GitHub, Zenodo automatically makes an archival copy of the repo and issues that release with a DOI.

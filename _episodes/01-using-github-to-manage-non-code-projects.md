At the end of this episode, learners will be able to:

* List reasons why GitHub is a suitable platform for collaborative, non-code projects
* Know where to get help with GitHub and its features

Teaching: 10 minutes

[GitHub](https://github.com/) originally started as a collaborative platform for software development projects. Based on git, it has a robust version control system that allows one or more people to work concurrently on a project, have a formal review process, and manage conflicts between contributions.

## Version control

A version control system is commonly used in software develop to manage all the files a project contains. The system tracks all changes to a set of files it has been directed to monitor, and maintains a full history from its initialisation. In case of emergency, a user can easily roll an entire project, or portions of a project, back to a previous state. A version control system is *not* a suitable replacement for a proper backup regime.

## GitHub and git

[GitHub](https://github.com/) and similar sites such as [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) all use [git](https://git-scm.com/) as their underlying technology. Git can run on almost any computer and is available for both command line and graphical user interfaces. Git support is also integrated into many text editors and integrated software development environments.

This lesson focuses entirely on working on the GitHub platform, but many of the concepts introduced also apply to GitLab and BitBucket.

## Building on git

On top of its version control and collaboration capabilities, GitHub also offers a number of other features that make it useful for project management.

**Issues** help you track and discuss your to-do items.

**Wikis** let you construct knowledge bases.

**Discussions** are like online forums.

**GitHub Pages** let you create [static websites](https://au-research.github.io/github-training/) by writing [Markdown files](https://github.com/au-research/github-training) and applying a template.

**Projects** help you manage projects and workflow using a project board.

If you want to learn more about any of the features this workshop covers, or any of the features this workshop does *not* cover, GitHub has an excellent [help resource](https://docs.github.com/en).

A GitHub repository is not an appropriate platform for rapid, live collaboration on a single document. The process of committing and reviewing changes would make it too unwieldy. For this kind of collaboration a real-time, collaborative document editor like Google Docs, Microsoft Word 365, or etherpad would be more appropriate.

Last, but not least, using a GitHub repository for a well-structured, collaborative project enables the development of FAIR outputs. We'll be going more into this over the course of this workshop.

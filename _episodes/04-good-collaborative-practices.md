In GitHub, issues are a way of creating, assigning, and tracking tasks in a project. The way issues are used in a project should be agreed upon by the members of the project team.

Creating a new issue requires a title - a short description of the problem to be solved. It is helpful to add a longer description in the initial comment field. These comments can use GitHub-flavoured markdown to add formatting, including checklists.

**Discussion** (5 minutes): Considering your training materials repo, what sort of issues would you expect to be raising with your collaborators? Share in the chat.

**Demonstration** (5 minutes): Create a new issue and assign it to yourself. Use [GitHub-flavoured markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to add a checklist of items within the issue description (hint: use square brackets).

**Challenge** (10 minutes): Create a second issue and assign it to your partner. Were you successful? If not, ask your partner to comment on the issue and try to assign it to them again.
